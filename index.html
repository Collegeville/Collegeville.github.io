<h1>Collegeville: The Art & Science of Computational Science</h1>
<h3>The Collegeville organization is dedicated to studying, developing, teaching and promoting better computational science and engineering (CSE)</h3>
<p>
Scientist and engineers use computation as a part of their everyday discovery and design processes.  In order to improve the effectiveness of computational approaches, the Collegeville Project is focused on studying, developing, teaching and promoting theory and best practices in CSE.
</p>

<p>
While many people work to improve the effectiveness of CSE while simultaneously working on a specific CSE project, we are looking at the process of <it>how</it> CSE work is done as a first order concern in its own right.
</p>

<p>Some of the content in the Collegeville Project comes from a capstone course on computer science methodologies taught by Michael Heroux since 1998.  This material draws upon and develops best practices in oral and written discourse, with the basic goal of always improving each scientist's personal skills for effective communication.  Two sub-projects under the Collegeville Project are:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://Collegeville.github.io/Scribe"> The Scribe Project: Effective Writing.</a>
<li> <a href="https://Collegeville.github.io/Orator"> The Orator Project: Effective Speaking and Listening).</a>
</ul>
